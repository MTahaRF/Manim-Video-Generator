# MathViz - AI Video Generation Tool (Prototype)

## Overview
MathViz is an AI-powered video generation tool that creates educational videos based on a given topic. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate scripts and visuals dynamically. This project serves as a **prototype** for exploring AI-driven content creation.

## Features
- **Topic-Based Video Generation**: Input a topic, and MathViz generates a complete video.
- **Multiple LLM Options**: Choose between **GPT** and **Gemini** for script generation.
- **Automated Workflow**:
  - Generate a script using LLMs.
  - Create corresponding video visuals.
  - Adjust video length to match the audio.
  - Merge all segments into a final output.
  - Cleanup temporary files after processing.

## LLM Support
MathViz supports both:
- **GPT (Azure OpenAI Service)**
- **Gemini (Google AI)**

## Notes
- This project is currently a **prototype**, and further improvements are planned.
- Future enhancements may include better visuals, improved narration, and UI integration.
